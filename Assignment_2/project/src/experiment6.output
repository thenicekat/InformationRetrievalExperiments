Syndrome, HBOC Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz. (called Baizhu in China) is a medicinal plant that has long been used as a tonic agent in various ethno-medical systems in East Asia, especially in China, for the treatment of gastrointestinal dysfunction, cancer, osteoporosis, obesity, and fetal irritability. Routine measurement of serum Gln concentrations could facilitate improved diagnosis and treatment of severe infections, anorexia nervosa, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and cancer. Epidemiological studies demonstrate that a high dietary intake of carotenoids may offer protection against age-related macular degeneration, cancer and cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. PPARγ agonists have been reported as a new and potentially efficacious treatment of inflammation, diabetes, obesity, cancer, AD, and schizophrenia. D061325 It was observed that JTC-801 inhibited the proliferation, invasion and migration of cancer in SKOV3 cells. This study shows that ebselen, which is a promising drug candidate against cancer, bipolar disorder, and the viral infection coronavirus disease 2019, covalently bonds to cysteine residues in 14-3-3 adaptor proteins, triggering destabilization and increased degradation in cells and intact brain tissue when used in therapeutic concentrations, potentially explaining the behavioral, anti-inflammatory, and antineoplastic effects of this drug. HBOC Syndrome The cellular energy and biomass demands of cancer drive a complex dynamic between uptake of extracellular fatty acids (FA) and their de novo synthesis. The NR4A1-3 (Nur77, NURR1 and NOR-1) subfamily of nuclear hormone receptors (NRs) has been implicated in Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, manic depression, atherogenesis, Alzheimer's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, cancer and apoptosis. Mildly elevated systemic bilirubin concentrations, such as in Gilbert syndrome (GS), protect against various oxidative stress-mediated and metabolic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, cancer, and age-related disease. anxiety Capsaicin has been shown to have favorable effects on various diseases including atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases, stroke, obesity, hypertension, cancer, and gastrointestinal and inflammatory diseases. Natural products, such as ginger, curcumin, and gingko biloba have been used as diets and dietary supplements to treat human diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular, respiratory, infectious, diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndromes, and neurological disorders. In humans, oxidation of Ch is commonly linked to various pathologies like Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis, and even cancer, which proceed via mechanisms involving enzymatic and free radical pathways. Haloperidol, a neuroleptic agent (antipsychotic) that is a potent dopamine blocker, is the drug of choice for the treatment of delirium in persons with cancer because of the low incidence of related cardiovascular and anticholinergic effects. DM DISEASE In addition to the reductions in blood glucose and insulin achievable through carbohydrate restriction, chronic ketosis might confer unique metabolic benefits of relevance to cancer, neurodegenerative conditions, and other diseases associated with insulin resistance. Smoking tobacco, drinking alcohol, and chewing betel quid are health-risk behaviors for several diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes, with severe impacts on health. cause Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome The effects of PPARγ agonists, known for their positive activity on type II diabetes mellitus, have been explored and present promising effects in the control of neuropathic pain, including CINP, and also cancer. Selenium deficiency may predispose to immune deficiency, mood disorders, and cancer. Low serum calcidiol concentrations are associated with an increased risk of several chronic diseases including osteoporosis, cancer, diabetes, autoimmune disorders, hypertension, atherosclerosis and muscle weakness all of which can be considered aging-related diseases. The incidence of cancer is significantly higher in patients with DM than in those without DM. extracellular fatty acids Cysteinyl leukotrienes receptor antagonists (LTRAs) are promising chemoprevention options to target cysteinyl leukotriene signaling in cancer. The first in class CXCR4 antagonist, plerixafor, was approved by the FDA in 2008 for the mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells and several other drugs are currently in clinical trials for cancer, HIV, and WHIM syndrome. drug Low levels of vitamin D have been implicated in a wide variety of conditions highly prevalent in the geriatric population, including fractures, functional limitations, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and depression. HBOC Syndromes cancer Specific sialidase inhibitors are useful for the treatment of influenza, epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, different types of cancer, or heart defects. The interplay between CXCL12/CXCR4-CXCR7 and GABA/GABAA-GABAB receptors systems could have many physiological implications in neurotransmission, cancer and inflammation. Morinda citrifolia L. (NONI) fruits have been used for thousands of years for the treatment of many health problems including cancer, cold, diabetes, flu, hypertension, and pain. Syndromes, HBOC The International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified several antineoplastic drugs in Group 1 (human carcinogens), among which chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide (CP) and tamoxifen, Group 2A (probable human carcinogens), among which cisplatin, etoposide, N-ethyl- and N-methyl-N-nitrosourea, and Group 2B (possible human carcinogens), among which bleomycins, merphalan and mitomycin C. The widespread use of these mutagenic/carcinogenic drugs in the treatment of cancer has led to anxiety about possible genotoxic hazards to medical personnel handling these drugs.
